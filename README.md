# Rust SIMDings

## About

The purpose of this project is to test the different ways of processing multiple elements in Rust, from the deliberately unoptimized to the fastest function. It is more a naive series of experiments rather than a scientific approach to optimization in Rust - although it might become that when I'll get the hang of it. It is also an exercise in getting used to Rust idioms.

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clemarescx/simd_bench.git
